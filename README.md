Initialize xampp server and add a database as yash (or your name) then run the first query in add.php while commenting out the rest of them and do  the same for all quesries in that file.
Now, add all the files in this Repo to a Folder created in htdocs folder and run VScode.
Now, install Twilio SDK for PHP by running the following code in your directory.

```
mkdir twilio-php-app
cd twilio-php-app
composer init --require=twilio/sdk
```

Ensure that your code is complete by adding the Twilio Credentials and generate a Twilio service number and remember that you can send message to only the number by which you are logging into your Twilio console.

Rest it will work fine. Happy Coding!!!
